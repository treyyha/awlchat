        <p className="mt-3">
          A business owner signs in by email, connects an Instagram professional
          account through Meta OAuth, creates a keyword campaign for a post or
          reel, and receives a webhook when someone comments. AwlChat queues
          the event, deduplicates it, checks rate limits, then sends a private
          reply using the comment ID.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">Compliance Position</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The app uses official Meta APIs, verifies webhook signatures, encrypts
          tokens, avoids scraping, avoids password collection, and sends no more
          than one private reply for a matched campaign/comment pair.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground">Review Test Notes</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Reviewers can use a Meta test business, connect an Instagram
          professional account, create a keyword such as LINK, comment that
          keyword on the selected media, and confirm that the private reply is
          sent and logged once.

        <p className="mt-3">
          We collect account email addresses for authentication, workspace and
          billing metadata, connected Instagram account identifiers, encrypted
          Instagram access tokens, campaign settings, webhook payloads,
          comments needed to process campaigns, delivery logs, and operational
          diagnostics.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">How We Use Data</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          We use this data to authenticate users, connect Instagram
          integrations, match comment keywords, send private replies through the
          official Meta APIs, prevent duplicate sends, troubleshoot failures,
          and protect the service.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Instagram And Meta Data</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          AwlChat does not ask for Instagram passwords, scrape Instagram, or
          use browser automation. Instagram tokens are encrypted at rest and are
          used only to perform actions authorized by the connected business
          account.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Subprocessors</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The production service may use hosting, database, Redis queue, email,
          and observability providers such as Vercel, Railway, PostgreSQL,
          Redis, and Resend. These providers process data only as needed to run
          the service.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Retention And Deletion</h2>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Customers can disconnect Instagram from settings, which removes the
          stored Instagram connection and stops campaigns. For account or data
          deletion, follow the Data Deletion page linked from the footer.

          Sign in, open Settings, and select Disconnect. This removes the stored
          Instagram connection token and stops campaigns from sending private

          To delete workspace, campaign, log, webhook, billing reference, and
          operational diagnostic data, contact support from the email address
          used to sign in. Include the workspace name and the Instagram username

          business account before deleting data. Deletion requests are processed
          as quickly as practical unless retention is required for legal,
          billing, fraud prevention, or security reasons.
